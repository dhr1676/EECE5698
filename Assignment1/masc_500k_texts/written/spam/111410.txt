Hello ,

How are you today ?

I hope you are fine and all is well with you . I got your contact as i was looking for a good relationship. I am sorry
to bother you with my proposal for a relationship with you , but i know that you will grant my request in good faith and
understanding .

My name is Miss Priscilla. , i am an honest , sincere and God fearing lady . I believe that color , religion , language
, age , country , tribe , distance etc has nothing to do with real friendship , i believe real friendship is all about
love , care , trust etc for each other . I believe we can move from here .

I would like to know more about you , as soon as i receive your mail i will tell you more about myself and send you my
pictures . I will be waiting for your mail as soon as possible . Till i hear from you remain blessed and have a happy ,
wonderful and splendid days ahead .

Cheers ,

Miss Priscilla
