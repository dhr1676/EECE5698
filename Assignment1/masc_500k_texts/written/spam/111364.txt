Dearest One,

Please l know very well that this mail might come to you as a surprise, I am rs Dagmar a dying woman who has decided to
donate what I have to the Church, Mosque or any Charity Organization round your community through your assistance since
l will not be able to do this here in my community for the reason which l will explain to you later. I was diagnosed for
cancer for about 3 years now after the death of my husband (Dr. Patrick Irlandese) who has left me everything he worked
for. My doctors told me I will not live longer than some weeks because of my health I decided to WILL/ DONATE the sum of
4.5 Million to you since I don't have a child rather than allowing my late husband's relatives that compare for his
death to use my late husband hard earned funds ungodly.

For the fact no one else knows the existence of this fund in the family, As my late husband warned me not to disclose
this issue to any of his brethren before his death. So Please you should contact me immediately if you accept to carry
on this project with your complete contact informations Comprising your Complete Names,Address, Direct Telephone and
Your ccupation so that I can put you in contact with the establishment where the money was deposited or a lawyer to
enable you arrange with them on how to secure the money for the purpose mentioned above,

I can't predict what will be my fate by the time you will receive the funds, But you should please ensure that the fund
is used as l have described above.You should reply urgently for more explanation.

Best Regards,
Mrs Dagmar Irlandese
