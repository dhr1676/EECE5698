Subject: SEO: Long Lasting Results that Boost Business
Reply-To: reply2tw@hokuunlimited.com



 
Nancy,
Were you aware that nearly every purchase starts online today? Surveys show that 92.5% of adults said they research products online before buying them in a store. 62% of search engine users clicked on a search result within the first results page, while the other 28% clicked within the second or third page. Think of all the other listings beyond the third page that aren't being seen. Is your company one of those unfortunate results? If you aren't visible, your competitors certainly are. Making use of SEO will solve that problem.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing one's website to gain better results in search engines such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing.
It's a marketing technique that is definitely worth looking into because it yields long lasting results and is absolutely affordable. We guarantee results. Wouldn't you have the utmost confidence in a company that was founded by former Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft employees?
