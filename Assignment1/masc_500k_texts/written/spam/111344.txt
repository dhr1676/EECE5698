Subject: Important: Database Maintenance Update ! ! !



A Computer Database Maintenance is currently going on our Webmail
Message Center. Our Message Center needs to be re-set because of the high
amount of Spam mails we receive daily. A Quarantine Maintenance will help us
prevent this everyday dilemma.
To re-validate your mailbox Please Click on the link below:

Failure to re-validate your mailbox will render your e-mail in-active
from our database.

Thanks
Susan Barch
System Administrator.
