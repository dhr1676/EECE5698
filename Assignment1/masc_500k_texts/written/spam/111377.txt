Subject: Important, I Really Need You On This.....



Hi,

I'm connecting with you in respect to confirm if you are eligible enough to go into business with me. I have a
proposition and I'm in need of a partner.

My questions are:
1. Can you handle a financial project ?
2. Can I give you this financial trust as a trustee/stake holder ?

If yes, get back to me as soon as Possible. I apologize if the content hereunder are contrary to your moral ethics, but
I had to reach you through this medium and further do respond to me using my secured email address underneath my names
below.

Sincerely Yours,
Dr. Fred. H.E
