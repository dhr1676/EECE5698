I'm not sure if you are aware of it or not, but many merchants are currently having their credit card processing
rates increased significantly. Some providers have or will be informing their clients, but others could simply be
increasing fees slowly over time. The bottom line is, it would be wise to get competitive bids from multiple credit card
processing companies sooner rather than later. Many merchants are overpaying for credit card processing fees by up to
30%, and don't even know it. Could this be you?

Go to: http://www.mysasan.info/bb/ to have multiple credit card processing
companies bid for your business today. Only the lowest bidding vendor and the vendors that you select will receive your
information, so you won't be inundated with solicitations.

That's right! You can now get competitive bids
from multiple credit card processing companies at once. Compare these rates against your current provider and see what
you could be saving, or at the very least verify that your current rate is competitive. Odds are, you can cut your
processing fees substantially and improve your bottom line immediately. We estimate that at least 80% of merchants are
significantly over paying for credit card processing.
