Hi sweety
Have not heard from you for ages!
Are you forgotten about me? Hope not!
How are you?
I am still single.. all of my friends are hanging out with their boyfriends and I am alone ;-(
Though we might get to know each other better and perhaps this Spring will be the last lonely spring for us?
I have registered my profile at http://onlinerussianbrides.cn/  - why don√≠t you come and see my new photos? And perhaps even email me..

Will be waiting
