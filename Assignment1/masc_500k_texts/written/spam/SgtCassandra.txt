Hello Dear
 
I am Cassandra Roach"

A US Army and currently on deployment here in Iraq...

I am from Austin, TX, I am also a former US Marine infantry, having served 12 active years with different infantry
units, from Camp Pendleton, CA. (1st battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, and 2nd battalion, 1st Marine Regiment) and Camp
Lejeune, NC (3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment), I have a 3years old daughter living with my parent in Texas, I am the
first born and daughter of my parent, I have a younger brother call Kelvin. I am presently serving in the Supply,
Logistics and Relief Unit of the first Armour-ed Div of the US Army in Iraq .

 As you maybe aware, we are constantly being attacked by insurgents and suicide Bombers.

During one of the heavy attacks against our unit, my colleague Sgt Amanda and I managed to secure some fund which was a
part of UNITED NATIONS relief package for displaced refugees.

The total amount is US$20 Million dollars in cash, mostly 100 dollar bills. We are in need of a reliable civilian of a
non American, in whose custody we can entrust this funds pending our disengagement from the front line.

Sgt Amanda and I agreed to send this email to you, just to inquire if you are the right individual to deal with in this
matter. Now we look forward to your prompt response to this, indicating your willingness or otherwise to work with us to
secure this fund for the good of the three of us.

In responding to this mail kindly furnish us with your personal details and direct contact details. So that we can go
further to explain to you how we intend to get the funds to you and work out the basis of trust and understanding as
well as how to appropriate shares to each parties.

Looking forward to read from you soon.
  
Respectfully yours 
Sgt Cassandra R.
