Microsoft System Administration is currently working to improve on the security of all our Microsoft Outlook Web Access
Users as we periodically review certain Accounts which are vulnerable to Unauthorized Access. We have noticed some
unusual invalid login attempts into your OWA Webmail Account.

Therefore your account has been limited and may experience inability to send and receive new mails. To remove this
limitation and initiate your Account Update process, please click on the link below to complete the form.
