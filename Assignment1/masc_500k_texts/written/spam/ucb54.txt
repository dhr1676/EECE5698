 What is Erectile Dysfunction (ED)? Erectile dysfunction, sometimes referred
to as impotence, is the inability for a sexually active male to obtain
and sustain an erection for sexual purposes. In the past, this has been
very embarrassing for men, and a source of anxiety for their partners,
and, in fact, there has been very little diagnostic testing or treatments
available up until very recently.But now the problem has gone with VIAGRA!
