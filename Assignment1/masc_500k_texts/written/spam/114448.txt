Dear Name :

Recognizing that approximately half of the seventy-six million
‘boomers’ out there today are women became the main reason that two
talented doctors dedicated their life’s work to providing the most
advanced information for women who are approaching, or have already gone
through, menopause.  They have managed to cut through all the hype and
controversy that surrounds menopause in their latest book - a virtual
makeover and guide that helps make the smoothest transition through this
very natural occurrence in a woman’s life.  Please read the following
press release and let me know if you are interested in receiving a copy of
their book for consideration of an engaging interview, or to provide a
review.  Thank you.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Two dedicated doctors did their part to make sixty the new forty for all
women - thanks to their virtual makeover

LaPorte, IN, February 21, 2011 - Even in our modern world, ‘menopause’
still bears a stigma and people still speak about it softly for fear that
it might be contagious.  Truth is, every woman has to go through it; there
is no way to avoid it - so why not get the best possible information to
help in the transition?  Doctors David C. Miller and Lovera Wolf Miller
understand this and it is a primary reason they wrote Womenopause: Stop
Pausing and Start Living (O-Books) – an exceptional book that acts as an
informative yet compassionate guide through menopause.

Even the most self-assured woman anticipates this very natural occurrence
with dread, conjuring up visions of decline and even associating it with
losing their looks – or worse, possibly even their husbands!  
Womenopause was written to help the over six thousand women reaching
menopause in America every single day, and Drs. David and Lovera Miller
recognize that there is a real need for help on this sensitive subject that
encompasses more than half of a woman’s lifetime between peri-menopause
and post-menopause.

Womenopause is a breath of fresh air to many women because it offers real
solutions on everything from hormones and hot flashes, brain and bone
preservation, breast health, skin, fitness, food, sleep, to intimacy and
more.  In other words, it is packed with thirty years of proven success
rather than a swing in trends that has become ‘the cure du jour!’

The superior credentials of both doctors authenticate how they have devoted
their lives to helping menopausal women.  Dr. Lovera is a board certified
obstetrician and gynecologist, a Fellow of the American College of
Obstetrics & Gynecology, and a certified menopause practitioner.  Dr. David
Miller is boarded in pain and anesthesiology, taught neuroanatomy at UCLA,
was an instructor of courses in physiology and neurophysiology, and is also
a certified menopause practitioner. Please visit their informative websites
