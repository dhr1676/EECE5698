Hello..

I am Fredrick Clifton, i work with a CHEMICAL CO. We supply to the industries here in UK. a chemical used for the
purification of rough diamonds and precious stones. This chemical is in high demand here in UK and i found it very cheap
in Asia precisely Malaysia. it is manufactured in North Korea but because of the Export duties in North Korea and some
product cannot be exported directly to UK that is why we buy from Agents, i need a middle person who can transact the
business with me, the person will buy from the agent in Malaysia, and resale to my company at the quoted price.

if you are interested i will introduce you to my company as the agent dealing on this chemical in Asia, you will buy
from the agent and resale to my company. my company will be sending our representative to Asia to purchase this chemical
and i don't want them to go directly to the agent because of the price which i have quoted to them for this will cause a
conflict of interest and i stand the risk of losing my job that is the more reason i need a middle person in this
transaction(the person am supposed to use as middle man is not buoyant).

This business is in this dimension as you will not take my company representative to the main distributor to avoid
direct transaction from the source, since this is where we will be making our profits, thereafter share the profits
after mapping out the money input costs. I don't know if we can make this together as this is a long term and continuous
business, if this is acceptable by you get back to me ASAP. this is a personal deal between you and I, and i hope we
make our partnership/friendship/relationship indelible.

Yours Faithfully

Fredrick Clifton.
