Dear Patricia Collier, *



I am a student at Classical High School( in Providence RI) and i am
conducting a research project for my graduation requirement. I ma writing to
you because i am hoping that you might provide me with some expertise or
knowledge about my topic.

My topic is about animal extinction and how humans are the major cause of
it, and explaining how humans are the cause, like how we pollute, how we
hunt..etc. I was looking for more info on animal extinction when i came
across an article on your website about animal extinction.

In addition to writing a research paper, i will be making an exhibition in
front of a panel of judges that will demonstrate a connection to the real
world. I will be making a powerpoint.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would be willing to talk with me about
my project. I have a few questions i would love for you to answer;

                                                            Questions

   1. What do you think society should do to increase animal extinction?
   2. How long have you been working with animals?
   3. What do you think is the main reason animals are becoming extinct?
   4. What are some ways to help?
   5. How can families do in their homes to help this cause?


Please let me know of you would be able to do this. You could email me back,
and let me know if you would like me to call you, email back and forth,
visit your organization, or whatever else would be appropriate. Please add
any contact information as necessary.

Thank You in advance for you assistance,
Sincerely,
