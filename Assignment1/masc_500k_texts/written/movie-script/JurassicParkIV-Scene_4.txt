Isla Sorna, day fourteen. I have been on this island for two weeks, and I've
seen no sign of either the T-Rex or the Spinosaurus. I have been to all of the
locations that the animals were said to frequent but without avail. I am out of
food and set to meet the helicopter at the designated meeting point in twelve
hours. I regret that I am coming home from this hunt empty-handed.
